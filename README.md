This project proposes a congressional redistricting plan that can withstand legal evaluation and adhere to state and federal regulations. Our proposed plan not only respects the basic criteria of redistricting (i.e., population balance concerning 1% deviation and contiguity) but also respects:

•	County preservation, which results in resolving the gerrymandering issue around Wyandotte County and decreasing the county splits from four to zero; and

•	Compactness concerning the number of cut edges (i.e., edges with endpoints belonging to different districts) by obtaining the minimum number of them in the proposed plan.
