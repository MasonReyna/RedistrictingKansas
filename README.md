Our Operations Research Redistricting Kansas project involved our team using Linear Programming to determine the optimal arrangement for Kansas' 4 congressional districts. Our Project Report, titled RedistrictingKansasProject, gives a detailed proposed solution and methods. The code/all files used are also included to keep our project clear and concise for others to view if they need to reference it. The Kansas county graph is taken from Daryl DeFord's website, and the Kansas shapefiles are taken from Eugene Lykhovyd's website. Both sites contain all 50 U.S. states and our professor gave us this information.
